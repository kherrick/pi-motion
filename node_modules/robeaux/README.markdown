# Robeaux

Robeaux (/rō-bō/) is a universal dashboard to your robotic devices. Like a router admin
page, but for robots.

Robeaux is powered by [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), and provides
a front-end to the API interface offered by [Artoo](http://artoo.io),
[Cylon.js](http://cylonjs.com) and [Gobot](http://gobot.io). It looks like this:

## How It Works

Thanks to using a structured interface based on the RESTful APIs of Artoo,
Cylon.js and Gobot, Robeaux can query or set values on one or more robots, and
all of the devices connected to each robot. As long as they are connected to
a compatible API server.

### Robots

You can see each robot that your are connected to, and then drill in to view or
edit it.

### Connections

How are you connected? Serial port? WiFi? View the details for each of your
robots.

### Devices

Each robot has one or more devices connected. You can view the device status and
send commands all via the web interface. You can even stream the real-time
event data for your buttons, switches, LEDs, sensors, and more.

## Themes

You can change the theme! Pick from one of the presets, or write your own. It'll
be persisted in `localStorage` and ready to go for the next time you want to use
Robeaux.

## Pushing new versions

Before you push a new release, make sure you've bumped the version in
`package.json` and `robeaux.gemspec`, and commited + pushed those changes.

Then, just run `make release`. It'll take care of:

- cutting a git tag
- pushing tags to GitHub
- building/pushing a new RubyGem
- publishing a new NPM release

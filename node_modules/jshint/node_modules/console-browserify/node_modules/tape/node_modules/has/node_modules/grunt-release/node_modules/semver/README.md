semver(1) -- The semantic versioner for npm
===========================================

## Usage

    $ npm install semver

    semver.valid('1.2.3') // '1.2.3'
    semver.valid('a.b.c') // null
    semver.clean('  =v1.2.3   ') // '1.2.3'
    semver.satisfies('1.2.3', '1.x || >=2.5.0 || 5.0.0 - 7.2.3') // true
    semver.gt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // false
    semver.lt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // true

As a command-line utility:

    $ semver -h

    Usage: semver <version> [<version> [...]] [-r <range> | -i <inc> | -d <dec>]
    Test if version(s) satisfy the supplied range(s), and sort them.

    Multiple versions or ranges may be supplied, unless increment
    or decrement options are specified.  In that case, only a single
    version may be used, and it is incremented by the specified level

    Program exits successfully if any valid version satisfies
    all supplied ranges, and prints all satisfying versions.

    If no versions are valid, or ranges are not satisfied,
    then exits failure.

    Versions are printed in ascending order, so supplying
    multiple versions to the utility will just sort them.

## Versions

A "version" is described by the v2.0.0 specification found at
<http://semver.org/>.

A leading `"="` or `"v"` character is stripped off and ignored.

## Ranges

The following range styles are supported:

* `1.2.3` A specific version.  When nothing else will do.  Note that
  build metadata is still ignored, so `1.2.3+build2012` will satisfy
  this range.
* `>1.2.3` Greater than a specific version.
*

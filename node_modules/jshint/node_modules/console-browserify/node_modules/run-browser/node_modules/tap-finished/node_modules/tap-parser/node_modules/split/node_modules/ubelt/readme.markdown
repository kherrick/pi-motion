#Utility Belt

writing utilities for doing all the little chores. 

then i'll reuse this everytime and never rewrite the basic stuff.

it's important to abstract and reuse anything that can be.

not to save you from rewriting the code, but to save you from retesting it.

I may have commited a sin by writing this myself when I have used underscore,
but it is better to NIH just once,
than to write it inline every time I need something.

this is actually starting to become quite useful.
